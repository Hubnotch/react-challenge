## My Comments
This is a basic Todo application for storing todo's. It's challenging I must say, 
largely because I started learning and working with react this year. In my previous company
most of the components are reusable, which didn't really push me the much I wanted to.
I couldn't complete the whole coding challenge because I wanted to use styled components, 
however I am getting a hang of it now. I have to use modular css to complete the styling of the
UI because of time. 
To be frank, my code is funky and unorganized, however, I will work on them as soon as possible.
Thank you Rapptr Labs team for this challenge. I'll get back at it and do a better job coding it and making it 
functional.
